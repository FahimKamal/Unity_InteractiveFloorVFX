# Unity InteractiveFloorVFX
In this project I have created some VFX assets by watching some Youtube tutorials. 
## Interactive Floor VFX
The floor beneath the player will react by players movement. It will give the feel that the rocks are floating and 
making a way for the player to walk. There are different properties that can be changed and modified to make the VFX
look and feel different. Watch tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/-6TOiW3glp0?si=UNoUNntzJSFOLFeo).

## Interactive Floor VFX Dots
This one I made based on the first one. I took what I learn from that and tried to make something different. 

## Fire Works VFX
This one I created by watching a tutorial from [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys). 
Watch tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/iCEHarLRCzI?si=9bHFMAr5UgnEwdv5).
